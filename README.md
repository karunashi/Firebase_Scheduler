Database will be checked perioodically to review all content to be correctly formatted. Time remaining in the tables are accurate based on user's internal (local) computer.

## Requirements
- Integrate Firebase database to the form so inputs are pushed into Firebase. 
- Moment.js integration so that all time tracked is real-time
- Time taken from local computer (moment.js)

## Code Explaination
Code should be familiar to the assignments in class. Attempts at Google Authentication were made, but it seems to always have some issue fully processing as it shows a single pop-up that disappears instantly once it appears. Attempted with redirect and pop-up instance for authentication.
